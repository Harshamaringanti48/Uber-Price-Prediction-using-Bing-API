Uber Price Prediction

This project aims to develop a web application using Streamlit that estimates Uber ride fares for different transportation modes, including Uber Go, Uber Premium, Uber Auto, and Uber Bike. The application integrates the Microsoft Virtual Earth API to determine the distance and travel duration between the specified start and end locations. Based on this data, it calculates the fare using predefined base prices, cost per kilometer, and cost per minute for each ride option. This tool provides users with quick and accurate cost estimates, enhancing their trip planning experience.
